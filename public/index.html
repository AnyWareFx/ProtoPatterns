    <h1>Welcome to ProtoPatterns</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to ProtoPatterns, a simple Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) stack
        to power your next web application.
    </p>


    <h2 id="design_goals">ProtoPatterns Design Goals</h2>

    <p>
        The ProtoPatterns project values most highly:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Simplicity</h3>

            <p>
                The server requires only Rails and the make_resourceful plugin. A single
                controller provides the base class for your application's RESTful controllers.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Convention</h3>

            <p>
                Taking a page from the Rails 'convention over configuration' philosophy, the
                client micro-framework also uses a predefined directory structure for XSLT view
                files. That's right, XSLT files. See the following link for the rationale behind
                this <a href="#xslt">design decision</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="design_decisions">ProtoPatterns Design Decisions</h2>

    <p>
        With any project, design decisions must be made based on constraints, philosophy, etc.
        This section outlines the design decisions made for the ProtoPatterns ROA stack.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>

            <p>
                Maybe you've heard that Ruby and Rails aren't scalable. Maybe you should see
                for yourself. The list of
                <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/applications">high-volume sites</a> running on
                Rails is impressive. No, your eyes don't deceive you. Twitter is on the list.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my experience, Rails has been the shortest distance between conception
                and deployment.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li id="xslt">
            <h3>XSLT</h3>

            <p>
                That's right, XSLT. I realize that XML has fallen out of favor with
                the rise of JSON, but there are a few very good reasons for choosing this
                representation over JSON and a multitude of others.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Compiled Code</h4>

                    <p>
                        That's right, compiled code. :-) The XSLT processors built into every
                        modern browser are compiled code - most likely C++. Transforming XML
                        into HTML is a (relatively) simple matter, and the compiled code should
                        easily outperform DOM building script. I said "should" because I haven't
                        taken the time to test this assertion. I suppose JIT compiled script
                        could perform almost as well, but I don't even know if any browser
                        has a JavaScript engine sophisticated enough to tackle this...
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Simplified API Server</h4>

                    <p>
                        Since the server only has to return XML and not HTML, the templates
                        can be processed on the client, which has more than adequate power
                        these days.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since the server is a simple API server, the client is responsible
                        for rendering the views, as well as implementing the controllers
                        and the interaction patterns controlling the flow between views.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="interactive_tests">ProtoPatterns Interactive Tests</h2>

    <p>
        The ProtoPatterns Interactive Tests are designed to provide interactive confirmation
        that the stack is working as advertised. Of course, Automated Tests are mandatory
        and are in the works for both the API server using Test::Unit and the client using
        the script.aculo.us Test.Unit framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, you can view the client script using Firebug, the Chrome Developer Tools,
        etc. I plan to also serve up the server code itself, complete with Railscasts-like
        syntax highlighting.
